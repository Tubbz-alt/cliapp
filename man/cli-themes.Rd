\description{
A cli theme is a named list. The names of the list elements are
CSS selectors that define whith CLI elements each style element applies
to. See <https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.asp> for a
reference on CSS selectors. We will also show some examples below.
}
\details{
Themes can come from three sources:
* The builtin theme of the cli package.
* The theme from the `cli.theme` option. (At the time when the
  `cli_class` object is created.)
* Themes added with he `add_theme()` method.
